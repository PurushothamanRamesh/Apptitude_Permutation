Here are the answers to the permutation and combination questions:

1. The two particular delegates must always sit together, so we can treat them as a single entity. Therefore, we have 24 entities to arrange, which can be done in 23! ways. The answer is A. 23!.

2. The boys and girls must alternate, so we can arrange them in the following pattern: BGBGBGBGB. The 5 boys can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways, and the 4 girls can be arranged among themselves in 4! ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 5! * 4!. The answer is C. 4! * 5!.

3. The word "LEADER" has 6 letters. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters is 6!. The answer is D. 720.

4. We have three cases to consider:
   i) Selecting 1 black ball and 2 balls from the remaining 7 balls: C(3,1) * C(7,2) = 3 * 21 = 63 ways.
   ii) Selecting 2 black balls and 1 ball from the remaining 7 balls: C(3,2) * C(7,1) = 3 * 7 = 21 ways.
   iii) Selecting all 3 black balls: C(3,3) = 1 way.
   The total number of ways is 63 + 21 + 1 = 85 ways. The answer is None of these.

5. The number of numbers greater than a million that can be formed with the given digits is 360. The answer is B. 360.

6. The gentleman can begin to write a letter in 6 * 7 * 4 = 168 ways. The answer is A. 168.

8. The team of 8 students can travel in two cars in 26 ways. The answer is B. 26.

9. Each of the 10 letters can be posted in any of the 5 post boxes. Therefore, the number of ways is 5^10 = 9765625. The answer is None of these.

10. The number of ways 15 people can be seated around two round tables with seating capacities of 7 and 8 people is (15C7) * 7! * (8-1)! = 15! / (7! * 8) = 5405400. The answer is None of these.

11. The relative position of vowels and consonants must remain the same. The word "EDUCATION" has 5 vowels (E, U, A, I, O) and 4 consonants (D, C, T, N). Therefore, the number of ways to rearrange the letters is 5! * 4! = 2880. The answer is None of these.
